    "\n",
    "**1. error_count(answers, predictions)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function calculates the total number of mistakes the model made.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Initialization:** It starts with a variable `count = 0`. This will store the number of incorrect predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Iteration:** It loops through the items using the length of the answers list/array. The code assumes answers and predictions are of the same length and in the same order\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Error Check:** Inside the loop, `if answers[i] != predictions[i]:` checks if the model's prediction at position i is different from the correct answer at the same position\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Counting Errors:** If the prediction is wrong, count is increased by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Return Value:** It returns the final count, which is the total number of misclassified samples\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simpler terms:** This counts how many times the model was wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. accuracy(answers, predictions)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function calculates the accuracy score of the model. Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Initialization:** It starts with a variable `count = 0`. This will store the number of correct predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Iteration:** Similar to the first function, it loops through all the predictions and answers\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Correct Check:** Inside the loop, `if answers[i] == predictions[i]:` checks if the model's prediction at position i is the same as the correct answer\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Counting Correct:** If the prediction is correct, count is increased by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Return Value:** It returns `count / len(answers)`:\n",
    "  - `count` is the number of correct predictions\n",
    "  - `len(answers)` is the total number of predictions (or samples)\n",
    "  - The result is a ratio, usually between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the model's accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simpler terms:** This calculates (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions). The result on the web page, Accuracy: 0.58179..., means the model was correct about 58.18% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "• Error count gives absolute number of mistakes\n",
    "• Accuracy gives percentage of correct predictions\n",
    "• Both functions help evaluate model performance\n",
    "• Accuracy score ranges from 0.0 (worst) to 1.0 (perfect)\n",

    "## 🚀 How to Run and Test Your FastAPI Service\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Run as a Server (Recommended for Development)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Save your FastAPI code to a file (e.g., `main.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Install required packages:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install fastapi uvicorn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Run the server:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Test using browser or curl:\n",
    "- **Health check:** Visit `http://localhost:8000/health` in browser\n",
    "- **Interactive docs:** Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs`\n",
    "- **API testing:** Use the automatic Swagger UI at `/docs`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: Test Directly in Notebook (FastAPI TestClient)\n",
    "The code above uses `TestClient` which lets you test your API directly in the notebook without starting a server. This is perfect for development and debugging!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 3: Using curl (Command Line)\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Valid request\n",
    "curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8000/predict\" \\\n",
    "-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "-d '{\"size\": 1800.0, \"bedrooms\": 3}'\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "🔄 FastAPI app starts\n",
    "📂 model = joblib.load(\"real_estate_model.pkl\")  # Takes 1-2 seconds\n",
    "✅ Model loaded into memory\n",
    "🚀 Server ready to accept requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. First Request Arrives**\n",
    "```\n",
    "📨 POST /predict {\"size\": 1800, \"bedrooms\": 3}\n",
    "⚡ Use existing model (already in memory) \n",
    "🔢 prediction = model.predict(X)  # Takes ~1 millisecond\n",
    "📤 Return {\"predicted_price\": 285000.00}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Subsequent Requests (Fast!)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "📨 POST /predict {\"size\": 1200, \"bedrooms\": 2}\n",
    "⚡ Use SAME model object (no loading needed!)\n",
    "🔢 prediction = model.predict(X)  # Still ~1 millisecond  \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Speed**: First request: ~1ms vs 2000ms\n",
    "- **Memory**: One model object vs new object per request  \n",
    "- **Scalability**: Handle 1000s of requests without reloading\n",
    "- **Resource**: CPU and disk I/O savings\n",

    "How to build professional APIs that are easy to use and understand. Think of this like learning to organize your house - we'll learn the \"rules\" that make everything predictable and clean.\n",

    "\n",
    "# **Lesson 1: Understanding REST - Think Like a Librarian 📚**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What is REST?**\n",
    "REST is like organizing a library. Instead of having random book piles everywhere, you organize by:\n",
    "- **Sections** (Fiction, Science, History)\n",
    "- **Shelves** (within each section)\n",
    "- **Individual books** (on each shelf)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Key Rule: Focus on THINGS, not ACTIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **❌ Bad Way (Action-focused)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "/getPrediction          # \"Get me a prediction\"\n",
    "/loadModel              # \"Load a model\" \n",
    "/checkModelStatus       # \"Check model status\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "These tell you WHAT TO DO, but not WHAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Good Way (Thing-focused)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "/models                 # \"Show me all models\"\n",
    "/models/house_price     # \"Show me the house price model\"\n",
    "/models/house_price/predictions  # \"Show me predictions from house price model\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "These tell you WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🎯 Practice Exercise**\n",
    "Your current API has `/predict`. In REST style, this becomes:\n",
    "- `/models/house_price/predict` (predictions FROM the house price model)\n",

    "Your API returns different formats randomly:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Sometimes you get this:\n",
    "{\"predicted_price\": 300000}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Other times you get this:  \n",

    "\n",
    "// And sometimes this:\n",
    "{\"error\": \"Model not found\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Solution: Use a Standard Envelope**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Success Response Template**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"status\": \"success\",\n",
    "  \"data\": {\n",
    "    \"predicted_price\": 300000,\n",
    "    \"confidence\": 0.8\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Error Response Template**\n",

    "    \"message\": \"Model not found\",\n",
    "    \"code\": \"MODEL_NOT_FOUND\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "# 🔐 API Authentication: Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **What is API Authentication?**\n",
    "Authentication is like a **VIP list at a club** - only people with the right credentials get in. For APIs, this means only requests with valid **API keys** can use your service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 **Why Do We Need It?**\n",
    "- **Control Access**: Not everyone should use your expensive ML model\n",
    "- **Track Usage**: Know who's making predictions  \n",
    "- **Prevent Abuse**: Stop unlimited free usage\n",
    "- **Different Permissions**: Web apps vs mobile apps vs admins\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **📋 Line-by-Line Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the authentication example step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 1: Import What We Need**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Header, Depends\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What each import does:**\n",
    "- `FastAPI` - Creates our API app\n",
    "- `HTTPException` - Used to send error messages (like \"Invalid API key\") \n",
    "- `Header` - Reads data from HTTP headers (where API keys are usually sent)\n",
    "- `Depends` - Makes functions run automatically before our endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 2: Create Valid API Keys**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "VALID_API_KEYS = {\n",
    "    \"sk_web_app_key_123\": \"web_application\",\n",
    "    \"sk_mobile_key_456\": \"mobile_app\", \n",
    "    \"sk_admin_key_789\": \"data_science_team\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What this means:**\n",
    "- Dictionary where **keys** = API keys, **values** = who owns them\n",
    "- In real apps, this would be in a **database**, not hardcoded\n",
    "- `sk_` prefix is common for \"secret key\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 3: Create the Security Guard Function**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def verify_api_key(x_api_key: str = Header(...)):\n",
    "    if x_api_key not in VALID_API_KEYS:\n",
    "        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid API key\")\n",
    "    return x_api_key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Line by line:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def verify_api_key(x_api_key: str = Header(...)):\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `x_api_key: str` - Expected to receive a string\n",
    "- `Header(...)` - FastAPI will automatically read `X-API-Key` from HTTP headers\n",
    "- `...` means \"this is required\" \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x_api_key not in VALID_API_KEYS:\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Check if the received API key exists in our valid keys dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid API key\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If key is invalid, send HTTP error 401 (Unauthorized) with message\n",
    "- This **stops** the request right here - user gets error, endpoint never runs\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return x_api_key\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If key is valid, return it (so we know who made the request)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 4: Protect Your Endpoints**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.post(\"/v1/models/house_price/predict\")\n",
    "def predict(data: dict, api_key: str = Depends(verify_api_key)):\n",
    "    # This code only runs if API key is valid!\n",
    "    prediction = model.predict([data[\"features\"]])\n",
    "    return {\"prediction\": prediction.tolist()}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The magic part:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "api_key: str = Depends(verify_api_key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `Depends(verify_api_key)` - **Automatically** runs `verify_api_key` function BEFORE running `predict`\n",
    "- If `verify_api_key` raises an error → user gets error, `predict` never runs\n",
    "- If `verify_api_key` succeeds → `predict` runs normally with the valid `api_key`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **🔄 How It Works: Request Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User sends request** with `X-API-Key: sk_web_app_key_123` in headers\n",
    "2. **FastAPI automatically** calls `verify_api_key()` first\n",
    "3. **verify_api_key** checks if `sk_web_app_key_123` is in `VALID_API_KEYS`\n",
    "4. **If valid** → continues to your `predict()` function \n",
    "5. **If invalid** → immediately returns 401 error, never reaches `predict()`\n",
    "\n",
