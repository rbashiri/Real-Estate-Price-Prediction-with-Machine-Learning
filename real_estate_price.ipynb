    "\n",
    "**1. error_count(answers, predictions)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function calculates the total number of mistakes the model made.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Initialization:** It starts with a variable `count = 0`. This will store the number of incorrect predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Iteration:** It loops through the items using the length of the answers list/array. The code assumes answers and predictions are of the same length and in the same order\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Error Check:** Inside the loop, `if answers[i] != predictions[i]:` checks if the model's prediction at position i is different from the correct answer at the same position\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Counting Errors:** If the prediction is wrong, count is increased by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Return Value:** It returns the final count, which is the total number of misclassified samples\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simpler terms:** This counts how many times the model was wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. accuracy(answers, predictions)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function calculates the accuracy score of the model. Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Initialization:** It starts with a variable `count = 0`. This will store the number of correct predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Iteration:** Similar to the first function, it loops through all the predictions and answers\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Correct Check:** Inside the loop, `if answers[i] == predictions[i]:` checks if the model's prediction at position i is the same as the correct answer\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Counting Correct:** If the prediction is correct, count is increased by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Return Value:** It returns `count / len(answers)`:\n",
    "  - `count` is the number of correct predictions\n",
    "  - `len(answers)` is the total number of predictions (or samples)\n",
    "  - The result is a ratio, usually between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the model's accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simpler terms:** This calculates (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions). The result on the web page, Accuracy: 0.58179..., means the model was correct about 58.18% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "• Error count gives absolute number of mistakes\n",
    "• Accuracy gives percentage of correct predictions\n",
    "• Both functions help evaluate model performance\n",
    "• Accuracy score ranges from 0.0 (worst) to 1.0 (perfect)\n",
