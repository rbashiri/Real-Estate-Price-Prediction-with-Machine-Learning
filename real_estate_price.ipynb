    "\n",
    "**1. error_count(answers, predictions)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function calculates the total number of mistakes the model made.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Initialization:** It starts with a variable `count = 0`. This will store the number of incorrect predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Iteration:** It loops through the items using the length of the answers list/array. The code assumes answers and predictions are of the same length and in the same order\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Error Check:** Inside the loop, `if answers[i] != predictions[i]:` checks if the model's prediction at position i is different from the correct answer at the same position\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Counting Errors:** If the prediction is wrong, count is increased by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Return Value:** It returns the final count, which is the total number of misclassified samples\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simpler terms:** This counts how many times the model was wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. accuracy(answers, predictions)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function calculates the accuracy score of the model. Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Initialization:** It starts with a variable `count = 0`. This will store the number of correct predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Iteration:** Similar to the first function, it loops through all the predictions and answers\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Correct Check:** Inside the loop, `if answers[i] == predictions[i]:` checks if the model's prediction at position i is the same as the correct answer\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Counting Correct:** If the prediction is correct, count is increased by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Return Value:** It returns `count / len(answers)`:\n",
    "  - `count` is the number of correct predictions\n",
    "  - `len(answers)` is the total number of predictions (or samples)\n",
    "  - The result is a ratio, usually between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the model's accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simpler terms:** This calculates (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions). The result on the web page, Accuracy: 0.58179..., means the model was correct about 58.18% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "• Error count gives absolute number of mistakes\n",
    "• Accuracy gives percentage of correct predictions\n",
    "• Both functions help evaluate model performance\n",
    "• Accuracy score ranges from 0.0 (worst) to 1.0 (perfect)\n",

    "## 🚀 How to Run and Test Your FastAPI Service\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Run as a Server (Recommended for Development)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Save your FastAPI code to a file (e.g., `main.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Install required packages:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install fastapi uvicorn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Run the server:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Test using browser or curl:\n",
    "- **Health check:** Visit `http://localhost:8000/health` in browser\n",
    "- **Interactive docs:** Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs`\n",
    "- **API testing:** Use the automatic Swagger UI at `/docs`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: Test Directly in Notebook (FastAPI TestClient)\n",
    "The code above uses `TestClient` which lets you test your API directly in the notebook without starting a server. This is perfect for development and debugging!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 3: Using curl (Command Line)\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Valid request\n",
    "curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8000/predict\" \\\n",
    "-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "-d '{\"size\": 1800.0, \"bedrooms\": 3}'\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "🔄 FastAPI app starts\n",
    "📂 model = joblib.load(\"real_estate_model.pkl\")  # Takes 1-2 seconds\n",
    "✅ Model loaded into memory\n",
    "🚀 Server ready to accept requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. First Request Arrives**\n",
    "```\n",
    "📨 POST /predict {\"size\": 1800, \"bedrooms\": 3}\n",
    "⚡ Use existing model (already in memory) \n",
    "🔢 prediction = model.predict(X)  # Takes ~1 millisecond\n",
    "📤 Return {\"predicted_price\": 285000.00}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Subsequent Requests (Fast!)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "📨 POST /predict {\"size\": 1200, \"bedrooms\": 2}\n",
    "⚡ Use SAME model object (no loading needed!)\n",
    "🔢 prediction = model.predict(X)  # Still ~1 millisecond  \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Speed**: First request: ~1ms vs 2000ms\n",
    "- **Memory**: One model object vs new object per request  \n",
    "- **Scalability**: Handle 1000s of requests without reloading\n",
    "- **Resource**: CPU and disk I/O savings\n",

    "## 🎯 **What We're Learning**\n",
    "How to build professional APIs that are easy to use and understand. Think of this like learning to organize your house - we'll learn the \"rules\" that make everything predictable and clean.\n",

    "\n",
    "# **Lesson 1: Understanding REST - Think Like a Librarian 📚**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What is REST?**\n",
    "REST is like organizing a library. Instead of having random book piles everywhere, you organize by:\n",
    "- **Sections** (Fiction, Science, History)\n",
    "- **Shelves** (within each section)\n",
    "- **Individual books** (on each shelf)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Key Rule: Focus on THINGS, not ACTIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **❌ Bad Way (Action-focused)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "/getPrediction          # \"Get me a prediction\"\n",
    "/loadModel              # \"Load a model\" \n",
    "/checkModelStatus       # \"Check model status\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "These tell you WHAT TO DO, but not WHAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Good Way (Thing-focused)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "/models                 # \"Show me all models\"\n",
    "/models/house_price     # \"Show me the house price model\"\n",
    "/models/house_price/predictions  # \"Show me predictions from house price model\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "These tell you WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🎯 Practice Exercise**\n",
    "Your current API has `/predict`. In REST style, this becomes:\n",
    "- `/models/house_price/predict` (predictions FROM the house price model)\n",
    "\n",

    "## **The Problem**\n",
    "Your API returns different formats randomly:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Sometimes you get this:\n",
    "{\"predicted_price\": 300000}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Other times you get this:  \n",
    "{\"result\": \"expensive\", \"confidence\": 0.8}\n",
    "\n",
    "// And sometimes this:\n",
    "{\"error\": \"Model not found\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Solution: Use a Standard Envelope**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Success Response Template**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"status\": \"success\",\n",
    "  \"data\": {\n",
    "    \"predicted_price\": 300000,\n",
    "    \"confidence\": 0.8\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Error Response Template**\n",

    "  \"error\": {\n",
    "    \"message\": \"Model not found\",\n",
    "    \"code\": \"MODEL_NOT_FOUND\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "# 🔐 API Authentication: Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **What is API Authentication?**\n",
    "Authentication is like a **VIP list at a club** - only people with the right credentials get in. For APIs, this means only requests with valid **API keys** can use your service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 **Why Do We Need It?**\n",
    "- **Control Access**: Not everyone should use your expensive ML model\n",
    "- **Track Usage**: Know who's making predictions  \n",
    "- **Prevent Abuse**: Stop unlimited free usage\n",
    "- **Different Permissions**: Web apps vs mobile apps vs admins\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **📋 Line-by-Line Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the authentication example step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 1: Import What We Need**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Header, Depends\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What each import does:**\n",
    "- `FastAPI` - Creates our API app\n",
    "- `HTTPException` - Used to send error messages (like \"Invalid API key\") \n",
    "- `Header` - Reads data from HTTP headers (where API keys are usually sent)\n",
    "- `Depends` - Makes functions run automatically before our endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 2: Create Valid API Keys**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "VALID_API_KEYS = {\n",
    "    \"sk_web_app_key_123\": \"web_application\",\n",
    "    \"sk_mobile_key_456\": \"mobile_app\", \n",
    "    \"sk_admin_key_789\": \"data_science_team\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What this means:**\n",
    "- Dictionary where **keys** = API keys, **values** = who owns them\n",
    "- In real apps, this would be in a **database**, not hardcoded\n",
    "- `sk_` prefix is common for \"secret key\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 3: Create the Security Guard Function**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def verify_api_key(x_api_key: str = Header(...)):\n",
    "    if x_api_key not in VALID_API_KEYS:\n",
    "        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid API key\")\n",
    "    return x_api_key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Line by line:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def verify_api_key(x_api_key: str = Header(...)):\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `x_api_key: str` - Expected to receive a string\n",
    "- `Header(...)` - FastAPI will automatically read `X-API-Key` from HTTP headers\n",
    "- `...` means \"this is required\" \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x_api_key not in VALID_API_KEYS:\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Check if the received API key exists in our valid keys dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid API key\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If key is invalid, send HTTP error 401 (Unauthorized) with message\n",
    "- This **stops** the request right here - user gets error, endpoint never runs\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return x_api_key\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If key is valid, return it (so we know who made the request)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 4: Protect Your Endpoints**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.post(\"/v1/models/house_price/predict\")\n",
    "def predict(data: dict, api_key: str = Depends(verify_api_key)):\n",
    "    # This code only runs if API key is valid!\n",
    "    prediction = model.predict([data[\"features\"]])\n",
    "    return {\"prediction\": prediction.tolist()}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The magic part:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "api_key: str = Depends(verify_api_key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `Depends(verify_api_key)` - **Automatically** runs `verify_api_key` function BEFORE running `predict`\n",
    "- If `verify_api_key` raises an error → user gets error, `predict` never runs\n",
    "- If `verify_api_key` succeeds → `predict` runs normally with the valid `api_key`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **🔄 How It Works: Request Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User sends request** with `X-API-Key: sk_web_app_key_123` in headers\n",
    "2. **FastAPI automatically** calls `verify_api_key()` first\n",
    "3. **verify_api_key** checks if `sk_web_app_key_123` is in `VALID_API_KEYS`\n",
    "4. **If valid** → continues to your `predict()` function \n",
    "5. **If invalid** → immediately returns 401 error, never reaches `predict()`\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like having a **bouncer check IDs** before letting people into the club!"

    "# 🚦 Rate Limiting: Step-by-Step Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **What is Rate Limiting?**\n",
    "Rate limiting is like a **speed limit for your API**. It controls how many requests someone can make in a certain time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a **coffee shop with a \"2 drinks per person\" rule** during rush hour - prevents one person from ordering 50 drinks and making everyone else wait!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 **Why Do We Need Rate Limiting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problems Without Rate Limiting:**\n",
    "- 🔥 **Server Overload**: Someone sends 10,000 requests per second → your server crashes\n",
    "- 💰 **Cost Explosion**: ML predictions cost money → unlimited usage = unlimited bills  \n",
    "- 😤 **Bad User Experience**: Heavy users slow down the API for everyone\n",
    "- 🤖 **Bot Attacks**: Malicious scripts can overwhelm your service\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Solutions With Rate Limiting:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Protect Your Server**: Maximum requests per user\n",
    "- ✅ **Control Costs**: Prevent unlimited expensive ML predictions\n",
    "- ✅ **Fair Usage**: Everyone gets reasonable access\n",
    "- ✅ **Stop Abuse**: Automatically block excessive usage\n",

    "# **📚 Step-by-Step Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 1: Install the Rate Limiting Library**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install slowapi\n",
    "```\n",
    "**SlowAPI** is the most popular rate limiting library for FastAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 2: Import Required Components**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from slowapi import Limiter\n",
    "from slowapi.util import get_remote_address\n",
    "from slowapi.errors import RateLimitExceeded\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What each import does:**\n",
    "- `Limiter` - Creates the rate limiter\n",
    "- `get_remote_address` - Identifies users by their IP address\n",
    "- `RateLimitExceeded` - Error thrown when limit is exceeded\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 3: Create the Limiter**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)\n",
    "app.state.limiter = limiter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What this means:**\n",
    "- `key_func=get_remote_address` - Track limits **by IP address**\n",
    "- Each unique IP address gets its own separate limit\n",
    "- `app.state.limiter = limiter` - Connects the limiter to your FastAPI app\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 4: Handle Rate Limit Errors**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded)\n",
    "def rate_limit_handler(request: Request, exc: RateLimitExceeded):\n",
    "    return JSONResponse(\n",

    "        content={\"error\": \"Too many requests\"}\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What this does:**\n",
    "- When someone exceeds the limit, this function runs automatically\n",
    "- Returns **HTTP 429** (Too Many Requests) with a clear error message\n",
    "- Instead of crashing, users get a polite \"slow down\" message\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 5: Apply Limits to Your Endpoints**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.post(\"/v1/models/house_price/predict\")\n",
    "@limiter.limit(\"10/minute\")  # ⭐ This is the magic line!\n",

    "- `@limiter.limit(\"10/minute\")` - Allow **10 requests per minute** from each IP\n",

    "- Request #11 in the same minute gets rejected with 429 error\n",

    "# **💡 Choosing the Right Limits**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **For ML APIs (like yours):**\n",
    "- **Predictions**: `10/minute` or `100/hour` (ML is expensive)\n",
    "- **Info endpoints**: `60/minute` (cheap to serve)\n",
    "- **Admin endpoints**: `5/minute` (sensitive operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Consider your users:**\n",
    "- **Web apps**: Need steady, moderate access\n",
    "- **Mobile apps**: Burst usage when user opens app\n",
    "- **Data science teams**: May need higher limits\n",
    "- **Free users**: Lower limits than paid users\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔥 **Three Key Features for Production APIs**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Different Limits for Different Users**\n",
    "Not everyone gets the same treatment:\n",
    "- **Free users**: Lower limits\n",
    "- **Paying customers**: Higher limits  \n",
    "- **Internal team**: Testing limits\n",
    "- **Enterprise**: Premium limits\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Communicating with Clients**\n",
    "Professional APIs tell clients:\n",
    "- **How many requests** they can make\n",
    "- **How many they have left**\n",
    "- **When limits reset**\n",
    "- **How long to wait** if they hit the limit\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Monitoring & Alerting**\n",
    "Track and log:\n",
    "- **Who** is hitting limits frequently\n",
    "- **Which endpoints** are most limited\n",
    "- **Potential abuse** patterns\n",
    "- **Clients who need upgrades**\n",

    "# **💡 How Each Feature Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Feature 1: Tiered Rate Limits**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Problem:**\n",
    "Everyone gets the same limit → unfair and unprofitable\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Different limits by user type\n",
    "RATE_LIMITS = {\n",
    "    \"free\": \"10/minute\",       # Free users\n",
    "    \"premium\": \"100/minute\",   # Paying customers  \n",
    "    \"enterprise\": \"1000/minute\", # Big clients\n",
    "    \"internal\": \"unlimited\"    # Your team\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Feature 2: Client Communication Headers**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Standard Headers:**\n",
    "- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total allowed per window\n",
    "- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests left in current window\n",
    "- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: When the window resets\n",
    "- `Retry-After`: How long to wait (when limit exceeded)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Response:**\n",
    "```http\n",
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n",
    "X-RateLimit-Limit: 100\n",
    "X-RateLimit-Remaining: 73\n",
    "X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640000000\n",
    "\n",
    "{\"prediction\": \"Affordable\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Feature 3: Monitoring & Logging**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What to Track:**\n",
    "- Limit violations by user\n",
    "- Most rate-limited endpoints\n",
    "- Usage patterns\n",
    "- Potential abuse\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Log:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "WARNING: Rate limit exceeded from API key sk_free_123 on /predict (5th time today)\n",
    "INFO: User sk_enterprise_789 approaching 80% of their limit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **🎯 Business Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Revenue Growth:**\n",
    "- Free users see limits → upgrade to premium\n",
    "- Enterprise clients get VIP treatment\n",
    "- Internal team can test without limits\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cost Control:**\n",
    "- Prevent abuse of expensive ML predictions\n",
    "- Fair usage across all customers\n",
    "- Predictable infrastructure costs\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Better User Experience:**\n",
    "- Clients know their limits upfront\n",
    "- Clear guidance when limits hit\n",
    "- No surprise failures\n",

    "# 📚 **Lesson: Professional API Documentation with FastAPI**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **What You'll Learn**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the most important lesson for any API developer! We'll learn how FastAPI automatically creates beautiful, interactive documentation that makes your API irresistible to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Documentation Matters** \n",
    "Think of documentation as your API's \"storefront\" - it's often the first thing developers see. Good documentation means:\n",
    "- **Faster adoption**: Developers can get started immediately \n",
    "- **Fewer support requests**: Clear docs answer questions before they're asked\n",
    "- **Professional credibility**: Well-documented APIs look trustworthy and mature\n",
    "- **Better integration**: Developers use your API correctly from day one\n",
    "\n",
    "### **FastAPI's Magic Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every FastAPI service automatically generates TWO documentation interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📊 Swagger UI at `/docs`**\n",
    "   - Interactive playground where developers can test your API\n",
    "   - Click, fill fields, hit \"Execute\" - see real responses\n",
    "   - Perfect for experimentation and learning\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **📖 ReDoc at `/redoc`** \n",
    "   - Clean, document-like format for systematic reading\n",
    "   - Great for understanding the complete API structure\n",
    "   - Professional presentation for stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Best Part?**\n",
    "The documentation is generated automatically from your code! When you update an endpoint, the docs update instantly. No more maintaining separate documentation that gets out of sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "# 📋 **Lesson 1: Basic Documentation Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Goal**: Create clear API metadata and basic endpoint documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of great documentation starts with three key elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. App Metadata** \n",
    "Your FastAPI app needs a good \"business card\":\n",
    "```python\n",
    "app = FastAPI(\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Input Models with Field Descriptions**\n",
    "Pydantic models are your documentation powerhouse:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n",
    "\n",
    "class HouseFeatures(BaseModel):\n",
    "    size: float = Field(\n",

    "        gt=0,                                   # Must be positive  \n",
    "        description=\"Square footage of apartment\",\n",
    "        example=850                             # Helpful example\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    bedrooms: int = Field(\n",
    "        ...,\n",
    "        ge=1, le=10,                           # Between 1-10 bedrooms\n",
    "        description=\"Number of bedrooms (1-10)\",\n",
    "        example=2\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Response Models**\n",
    "Show users exactly what they'll get back:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PredictionResponse(BaseModel):\n",
    "    prediction: str = Field(..., description=\"Price category: 'Affordable' or 'Expensive'\")\n",
    "    confidence: float = Field(..., description=\"Model confidence score (0.0-1.0)\")\n",
    "    price_threshold: int = Field(..., description=\"Threshold used ($113,000)\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔍 Why This Works**\n",
    "- **Field descriptions** appear in the documentation\n",
    "- **Examples** help developers understand expected values\n",
    "- **Validation rules** (gt=0, ge=1) show acceptable ranges\n",
    "- **Type hints** make the interface crystal clear\n",

    "\n",
    "Professional APIs document **what happens when things go wrong**. This is crucial because:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Error Documentation Matters**\n",
    "- **Reduces Support**: Developers know how to handle errors properly\n",
    "- **Better Integration**: Apps can provide meaningful error messages to users  \n",
    "- **Professional Trust**: Well-documented errors show you've thought through edge cases\n",
    "- **Debugging Help**: Clear error responses speed up troubleshooting\n",

    "1. **400 Bad Request**: Invalid or missing data\n",
    "2. **422 Validation Error**: Data format problems  \n",
    "3. **404 Not Found**: Resource doesn't exist\n",
    "4. **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limiting\n",
    "5. **500 Server Error**: Internal problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Professional Error Responses**\n",
    "Instead of generic errors, provide helpful details:\n",
